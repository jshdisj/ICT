                I will give you some of the best-tasting Laguna delicacies you can take home after visiting the province!
            </p>
            <p>
                Laguna is home to many cheap and relaxing pools and resorts, and the largest lake in the Philippines, 
                the Laguna de Bay (Lagoon of the town of Bay).  But Laguna is also popular for its tasty and unique delicacies! 
                If these are not enough reasons for you to visit Laguna, check out these tasteful delights you can bring home after 
                a colorful day spent in the province of Laguna.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">#1 Buko Pie</h3>
            <img src = "../IMG/bukopie.PNG" class="center">
            
            <p>
            The debate on which is the best buko pie in town has been going on around in Laguna for some time. From a local’s point of view, 
            Lety’s Buko pie is creamy and sweet. The flaky crust perfectly blends with the sweet filling. Moreover, the flakiness of the crust s
            till holds even after refrigerating.
            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, if you visit The Originals Buko Pie store, you will notice the long queue. And seeing this, you will be convinced that this is the best buko pie in town. 
            The renowned Colette’s buko pie, on one hand, has a doughy white crust and has a sweet filling. But, it is noticeable that it is less (coconut) meaty,
            and the sweetness of the custard overpowers the other buko pie layers. Although if you have a sweet tooth, this probably would be your best choice.

            <img src="../IMG/whitecheese.PNG" class = "center">
            <p>
                The key difference between the kesong puti and regular cheese is that kesong puti is white, unaged, 
                and has a salty texture. You can make your own kesong puti if you have carabao milk at home. However, 
                the kesong puti in Laguna is unique because carabao milk used here is fresh from the cattle. In fact, 
                the Home of Kesong Puti or Sta. Cruz, Laguna holds an annual festival due to this delicacys historical 
                relevance to the town.

            <p>
                Uraro, araro, or arrowroot cookie. It is made from the flour of the Maranta arrowroot plant. 
                The arrowroot cookie originated from southern Luzon namely, Laguna, Quezon and Marinduque. 
                Its production is somehow tedious because the process starts from flour making until cookies are made. 
                The makers don’t just use any other flour, since the arrowroot flour is what makes it unique from other cookies.
