                <p>Nagcarlan Underground Cemetary</p>
                The Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery has formally declared a National Historical Landmark in 1982 and was also dubbed as the only Underground cemetery in the country. 
                It is located in Barangay Bambang in Nagcarlan and was built in 1845 under the supervision of a Franciscan priest, Fr. Vicente Velloc. 
                This 1 hectare of land served as a public burial site for the people of Nagcarlan while the underground chamber below the chapel was exclusively built for the Spanish friars.
                Ever since it was declared a national historical landmark, no more burials were made in the cemetery.

            <p>
                The circular cemetery features a total of 240 apartment-type niches on the walls (120 niches on each side of the chapel). 
                The underground crypt, on the other hand, houses 36 additional tombs for the Spanish friars. Interestingly, the cemetery of Nagcarlan 
                is similar to the Paco Park and Cemetery in Manila. Both of which are circular cemeteries with hallowed walls that served as niches. 
                They are also both historically significant!

            <p>
                It is said that during the Philippine Revolution, the cemetery served as a meeting place for the revolutionary leaders of the Katipunan. 
                Pedro Paterno and Gen. Severino Taiño of the “Maluningning” command held a meeting at the cemetery where they planned the historic Pact of 
                Biak-na-Bato in 1897 which took place in San Miguel, Bulacan. In addition to that, the underground cemetery also served as a hideout for Filipino 
                leaders during the Philippine–American War and for guerillas in World War II. You can tell that the cemetery has witnessed a lot of historical events over 
                the years.

                The site is also built with a chapel. It comes with a very beautiful 
                façade built with red bricks similar to the materials used for San Bartolome Apostol Parish. 
                In fact, the cemetery was built together with the construction of the expanded St.
                 Bartholomew Parish Church and rectory. The facade comes with empty niches that probably
                  enshrined some saint statues before. There are a couple of small rose windows and a bell on top of its pediment.
