                <p>Hulugan Falls</p>
                Hulugan Falls is one of the tallest falls in Laguna province which is located in the municipality of Luisiana. 
                According to its history, Hulugan Falls has been a gem among locals until it became popular on social media accounts 
                such as Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram in the past decade. It has a height of 235 feet or 71 meters high. 
                It was said that the falls were named Hulugan due to the weird time when a carabao fall down to the falls because 
                of the strong water currents
            </p>
            <p>
                Hulugan Falls is one of the most visited places in the province of Laguna. It attracts thousands of tourists
                 every year due to its majestic cascading water and irresistible charm. It is just three hours away from Metro 
                 Manila and because of that, it can be visited within a day. In addition, tourist and visitors have a chance to 
                 chase not only one falls but three waterfalls. The other two nearby falls are namely Talay Falls and Hidden Falls.
                  So if you want to enjoy the beauty of nature and release stress through sightseeing, hiking and swimming then add
                   Hulugan Falls to your day tour travel bucket list.
