            <p>
                The Japanese Garden is one of many historical sites in Laguna. It is situated in Cavinti along the popular
                 Lake Caliraya. This beautiful garden was constructed in the 1970s to commemorate the Japanese occupation of the 
                 Philippines in World War II. Philippines-Japan Friendship Society built the shrine to honor Japanese soldiers who lost their 
                 lives during World War II. It is also rumored that the Yamashita Treasure, alleged war loot stolen by Japanese forces during 
                 the war, is buried within the garden's grounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you enter the grounds, you will be greeted by a large torii or a traditional Japanese gate. 
                These gates are often placed in shrines or spots that hold religious significance to let visitors know that
                 they are about to enter a sacred space. Past the gate, you will see open spaces of grass and towering trees
                  that offer shade for those hoping to enjoy a picnic. Further on, you will find a still, man-made lagoon that 
                    adds to the overall tranquil atmosphere of the garden. 
                    <p>
            A cement bridge over the lagoon leads you to a tall set of stairs.
             At the top of these steps, you will find yourself in another spacious 
             area of the garden where a solemn altar sits. The Along with the zen-like appeal
              of the garden, visitors can also climb a set of stairs to a hilltop. From here, you 
              can get a panoramic view of Caliraya Lake, which is another well-known spot in Laguna.
