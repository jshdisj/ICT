            <p>The mud spring is actually one of the few remaining mud pots left in Mt Makiling. It is highly acidic and sulfuric with steams constantly oozing. The spring emits a rotten egg-like smell. It is one of the volcanic features of the mountain.
                One of Mt Makiling’s eruptions happened in 1350.
